# NEURAL NETWORK TO PLAY CAR RACING GAME

## Goals

Implement a 2D Car Racing game environment using Pygame with possible play mode and ai mode.
Implement a Neural Network to play the game using Neat-python with categorical cross entropy loss function.

## Usage:
1) Make sure python3 and neat-python mentioned above are installed
2) Clone the repository from GitHub
3) Navigate into the folder
4) Open terminal and run

## Implementing your own Neural Network

Some of the parameters in config-feedforward.txt file are changeable. If you want to train your own Neural Network, config-feedforward.txt and change some of the variables as shown below:
1) network parameters
    - num_hidden - number of hidden neurons
    - num_inputs - number of input neurons
    - num_outputs - number of ouput neurons
2) pop_size - number of cars in one generation
3) settings of bias

Also can you change parameters in the code:
1) self.speed - speed of cars
2) self.surface - picture of cars
3) map - the map where cars drive. You can also draw your own map and add it in png format

I hope you enjoy my game)
